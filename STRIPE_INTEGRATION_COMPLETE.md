## üîê Environment Variables

The `.env.local` file has been created with your keys:

## üöÄ Going to Production

When ready to go live:

1. **Enable live keys in `.env.local`:**
   - Uncomment the production keys
   - Comment out the test keys

2. **Run the setup script in live mode:**

   ```
   (This will create real products in your live Stripe account)

3. **Set up webhooks** for:
   - Subscription created/updated/cancelled
   - Payment failed events
   - Customer updated

4. **Deploy to production** with proper environment variables
